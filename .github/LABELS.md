# Repository labels

Use these labels on issues and PRs for filtering and triage. Create them with `./scripts/create-labels.sh` (requires `gh` and auth).

| Label       | Color   | Use for |
|------------|---------|--------|
| `cursor`   | `#0E8A16` | Work done or proposed from Cursor IDE / AI-assisted |
| `llama.rs` | `#FEF2C0` | In scope for this repo (stevedores-org/llama.rs) |
| `docs`     | `#0052CC` | Documentation, roadmap, architecture |
| `roadmap`  | `#5319E7` | Roadmap / planning / priorities |
| `priority` | `#B60205` | Priority / P1 items |
| `rag`      | `#1D76DB` | RAG / semantic search / oxidizedRAG |
| `good first issue` | `#7057FF` | Good for new contributors |

When opening PRs from Cursor branches (e.g. `cursor/featA`), add labels: `cursor`, `llama.rs`, and any of `docs`, `roadmap`, `priority`, `rag` as applicable.
